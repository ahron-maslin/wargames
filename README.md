# Wargames
Simple batch script for easy SSH into the online Wargames challenges 

Instead of manually typing in the SSH address every time, this script will let you choose a game, and the level number so you can quickly advance to the next level number.
Additionally, it will save the last level on each challenge and display it the next time you use the program.
